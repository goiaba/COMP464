You should only compile and run very short tests on the log-in node on Stampede (that's the one you SSH into first). Longer parallel benchmarks should be run on a dedicated node in the system. The easiest way to get to a dedicated node is to type `idev`. The queue usually gives you interactive access within 1-2 minutes but sometimes things are backed up. Once you get an interactive session, you have 30 minutes to do whatever you want before the session terminates. If you need longer, I can help you request a longer interactive session. You can also develop code on Shannon first and run the final benchmark on Stampede.
