There are three ways to access Stampede:

1) ssh -l <your TACC user name> stampede.tacc.utexas.edu

2) i) ssh -l <your XSEDE user name> login.xsede.org; ii) gsissh -p 2222 stampede.tacc.utexas.edu

3) Log onto Shannon (see other how-to) and then use option (1).

Putty SSH is a good way to transfer files but that requires that option (1) is working. I'll figure out a strategy if option (2) is the only other way.
